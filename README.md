This is the repository for [my website](https://jamesmedd.co.uk). In the past 18 years I've gone from a Dreamweaver/Fireworks site, to a custom build from a third-party, to three iterations in Bootstrap, and a Hugo static site with my own custom theme. Now I've finally decided to try and make a site that I can iterate on in more easily in [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

I built most of it in just under two weeks of evenings and weekends, and while it's far from my best work, I like it. 

If you'd like one similar or you want to work with me, give me a shout.

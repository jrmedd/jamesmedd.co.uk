## Overview

<video src="/pixels.webm" caption='The debut of Sonic Pixels in Talbot Mill'></video>

Sonic Pixels is an interactive, spatial audio installation I co-developed with [Cornbrook Creative](https://sonicpixels.cornbrookcreative.uk/). It features an array of up to 25 speaker units, each one a self-contained, wirelessly controlled audio device encased in a transparent acrylic tube. Inside each unit is a 4-inch speaker, amplifier, microcontroller, LED lights, and a battery pack, all powered by a custom-built control system. The system allows artists to "paint with sound," with each pixelâ€™s position and colour corresponding to a unique sound. Control is managed via a bespoke iPad interface, with software written in MaxMSP and Python facilitating communication between the master controller and the speaker units.

## Initial exhibition

The first version of Sonic Pixels debuted at the Manchester Science Festival in 2017, as part of ["A Grand Exposition" at Talbot Mill](https://vimeo.com/264633269). This version explored the creative possibilities of spatial audio, with the 25-speaker grid enabling rich, multi-directional sound experiences. The units could be arranged in a traditional 5x5 layout or adapted for other configurations, such as linear corridors or outdoor parades. Each speaker played a role in a wider soundscape, with compositions from artists like Noise Orchestra and Gemma Nash, who created bespoke sonic experiences for the event. Installation was flexible, with the speakers either suspended from a ceiling-mounted wire grid or placed on custom floor stands.

## Barton Arcade

Building on this early success, Sonic Pixels evolved in 2018 with an installation at Barton Arcade, Manchester. This iteration pushed the concept further, integrating the system into a stunning Victorian glass and steel arcade. The spatial audio compositions, [including a new piece by Jaydev Mistry](https://vimeo.com/406223273), transformed the space into a living, breathing sound installation. The team collaborated with artists, technicians, and documentarian Michele Selway, who captured the entire process, from fabrication to the public launch. The Barton Arcade exhibition marked a milestone for Sonic Pixels, demonstrating its potential as a transformative public art experience.

## Project overview

Inspired by the Japanese Hanami festivals, every spring the National Trust celebrates blossom. In 2024, part of the celebrations are a set of poems, including haikus, and songs written by poet laureate, Simon Armitage. These are published in a book and an EP called Blossomise.

In Greater Manchester, the Trust’s Castlefield Viaduct, a temporary garden grown on a disused Victorian-era railway bridge, has produced a map of places to see blossom across the city. The digital map also includes trails so anyone can discover more of the nature on their doorstep.

This project invited the people of Manchester to compose and share Haikus about springtime and nature with the chance of having their poem  displayed a  big pink board in Sadler’s Yard, [NOMA](https://noma-manchester.com/).

There was a new one every day in April and they were on display in the windows of New Century House.

## What I designed and built

I designed and built a web application for the people of Manchester to submit their own haiku for the festival. This app helped people to compose their haiku by providing line-by-line syllable counts, and displaying the letters as they would appear on the board, helping people to consider the size of their haiku in the process. Users could also share a haiku on social media with an image generator built into the app.

Hundreds of poems were submitted, with some absolutely beautiful entries displayed on the board throughout the month.

## Project overview

Inspired by the Japanese Hanami festivals, every spring the National Trust celebrates blossom. In 2024, part of the celebrations are a set of poems, including haikus, and songs written by poet laureate, Simon Armitage. These are published in a book and an EP called Blossomise.

In Greater Manchester, the Trust’s Castlefield Viaduct, a temporary garden grown on a disused Victorian-era railway bridge, has produced a map of places to see blossom across the city. The digital map also includes trails so anyone can discover more of the nature on their doorstep.

We invited you to compose and share Haikus about springtime and nature with the chance that your poem could be displayed on our big pink board in Sadler’s Yard [NOMA](https://noma-manchester.com/).

There was a new one every day in April and you can see all of them on display in the windows of New Century House.

## What I designed and built

I designed and built an online application for people in Manchester to submit their own haiku for the festival. The application was a React frontend that helped people to compose haikus by providing syllabic validation for each line they wrote. The app rendered the user's input in the same style as the big outdoor board, encouraging users to consider the size of their haiku as they composed it.

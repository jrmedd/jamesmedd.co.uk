When I joined Blue Prism, I was stepping into a 20-year-old organisation that had never had a dedicated UX team. I was the second person on this newly formed team, reporting directly to the head of experience.

Blue Prism leads the way in [Robotic Process Automation (RPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation), helping businesses automate repetitive tasks for greater efficiency and accuracy. My role in the UX team wasn’t just to create better interfaces—it was to transform how the entire product team worked. Here’s how we did it.

## Driving change with a design system

Transitioning from Windows-only desktop software to the web called for a modern, lightweight, accessible design system. Here's how we made it happen:

- **Crafting a consistent design language**: We focused on colour combinations, fonts for international consistency (Europe, Asia), and accessibility.
- **Building collaboratively**: Components were designed in Figma, backed by a design backlog based on user needs. We worked closely with developers to meet all requirements.
- **Documenting for clarity**: Every component’s use cases and applications were documented for easy adoption by all team members.
- **Pioneering accessibility**: Leveraging my experience in accessible design, I provided detailed examples of ARIA attributes and interactive behaviour for developers.

## Establishing a user research programme

To support Blue Prism’s first web-enabled release, we took a user-centred approach:

- **Engaging globally**: I helped recruit over 20 customers for individual ethnographic studies, observing workflows and conducting interviews.
- **Uncovering pain points**: We identified areas for improvement, such as incident management and scheduling for companies handling thousands of automated processes.
- **Bringing the team closer to users**: Developers and product team members were invited to user sessions for the first time, gaining invaluable insights into real-world usage.
- **Iterating confidently**: Feedback from users shaped each design iteration, giving the team clarity and confidence in our development approach.

## Case studies

### Revamping complex scheduling

We found that high-performing customers were using the scheduler for more than just scheduling. They modularised processes into logical groups—authentication, queue-loading, fault-reporting, and more. The existing UI wasn’t designed for this complexity, forcing users into workarounds like external documentation and custom software.

Our proposed redesign mirrored their logic, allowing users to "drop-in" at any point, execute tasks, and reconfigure steps quickly.

### Proposing components

Each design system component started with a real use-case, like a datepicker or combobox. Figma was a game-changer for collaboration:

- Developers could inspect design elements directly, consuming colours, typography, and more without needing specifics.
- Behavioural details were documented with slides, and rich prototypes in tools like Framer brought interactions to life.

These efforts helped shape Blue Prism’s journey to the web, creating a solid foundation for scalable, user-centred design.

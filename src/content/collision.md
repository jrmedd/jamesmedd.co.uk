## Overview

![The three steps of the Collision app, from drawing a flag to planting a flag](collision_2)

"Collision" was my contribution to *this place [of mine]*, a digital arts initiative by [FutureEverything](https://futureeverything.org). This award-winning project gave young people across Greater Manchester a platform to envision the future of their high streets, combining creative digital tools and collaborative methodologies to inspire change.

## A high street in crisis

High streets are undergoing rapid transformation, especially post-pandemic. Young people, feel increasingly disconnected from these spaces. In workshops with FutureEverything, participants described their high streets as dull, uncreative, and devoid of ownership opportunities. Yet, they lit up when discussing vibrant online spaces like [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), where creativity and collaboration thrive. As one participant said, they wanted to see a "collision" between their digital and physical worlds.

## Reclaiming place through creativity

_Collision_ was my response to that idea. I created an online tool where people could design and plant digital flags in locations of personal significance. Drawing on the centuries-old tradition of flag planting as a symbol of ownership, participants were empowered to reclaim their spaces.

The browser-based pixel art tool used curated palettes from [Lospec.com](https://lospec.com), enabling participants to craft 16px x 16px flags, from simple to intricate designs. Once complete, flags could be "planted" in real-world locations using their device's location, and viewed in a virtual twin of Greater Manchester, built in Roblox. This transformed the city into a dynamic, user-generated art gallery that merged physical and digital landscapes.

## Amplifying voices, building skills

_Collision_ and _this place [of mine]_ and  didn’t just offer a creative outlet; they were tools for placemaking and empowerment. Participants explored themes of urban green spaces, collective ownership, and climate activism. As part of FutureEverything’s broader project, young people were mentored by artists, built digital skills, and became ambassadors for their high streets. 

The initiative reached thousands and received critical acclaim, earning awards for innovation and user experience. More importantly, it showcased how digital art can bridge gaps in engagement, giving young people the tools to shape their environments and futures.

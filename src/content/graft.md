My friend [Gemma Potter](https://gemmamaypotter.co.uk/) and I started [Graft Games](https://graft.games/) as a vehicle for exploring the places where craft and video games meet. It’s a collaboration that lets us play with ideas of making, skill, and gaming in a way that feels both fresh and oddly familiar. Our games invite people to get hands-on — not just with controllers, but with actions that feel closer to craft than button presses. We build experiences where making and playing become one and the same.

## Our games

### Hazuki

Our game [Hazuki](https://graft.games/hazuki), is inspired by classic “quick time events” (QTEs) from games like _Dragon’s Lair_, _Shenmue_, and _Resident Evil 4_ — that familiar feeling of reacting quickly to on-screen prompts. Instead of a gamepad, players work with a hand-powered knitting machine. Player 1 cranks the machine, controlling the pace of the on-screen prompts, while Player 2 has to press arcade-style buttons in time with the symbols on the screen. Get it wrong, and the rhythm is broken; get it right, and you feel that satisfying flow that comes with nailing a tough game sequence — or mastering a new craft technique.

_Hazuki Knit_ started life as a simple QTE game created by me, but the addition of the knitting machine, in collaboration with Gemma, completely transformed it. The machine itself has a real ‘80s aesthetic, so we leaned into that theme, creating a Game Boy version of Hazuki Knit. We produced custom cartridges and designed a custom peripheral that connects a Brother knitting machine directly to the Game Boy’s link cable port. This meant we could move away from the earlier Raspberry Pi version, making the game more portable and playable on actual Game Boy hardware. It’s hard to describe how surreal (but satisfying) it is to see a knitting machine and a Game Boy working together as part of the same experience.

But we didn’t stop there. At the 2018 London Games Festival, we ran an experimental version of Hazuki Knit in collaboration with knit artists [Sam Meech](http://portfolio.smeech.co.uk/) and [Marie Jones](https://mariejones.info/). We set up the game at the Guildhall Gallery, where players’ scores were automatically uploaded to an online database. These scores were then used to generate “re-knits” — digital-to-physical images inspired by the Seen and Heard: Victorian Children in the Frame exhibition. It was part high-score leaderboard, part collaborative textile project, with the final knitted images reflecting both player performance and the artistic context of the gallery. This is where Hazuki Knit really found its identity — not just as a game, but as a space for people to see the links between gaming, craft, and storytelling.

### Pocket Racer

Inspired by production and quality targets imposed upon garment factory workers, [Pocket Racer](https://graft.games/pocket-racer) is a racing game that uses a sewing machine for input. Rather than a needle and thread, the machines are loaded with pens! Players must race around a track based on a patch pocket shape. It's not only about speed though; racers will be disqualified if their stitching is inaccurate and they deviate from the track.

The initial version was first showcased at the Festival of Making. Players used a domestic sewing machine to “sew” a paper pocket outline as fast and accurately as possible. The goal was simple but addictive — follow the line closely to avoid rejection and aim for the fastest time. Player performance was judged in real time with an AI judge, with feedback on both speed and accuracy. The drive to beat personal and public high scores became a strong motivator, leading to playful repetition and attempts to perfect their technique.

For our second version, took the concept further by introducing real fabric instead of paper, adding a new layer of challenge and realism. This version was intended for use in a factory setting, but the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to rethink our approach. We recruited domestic machinists to engage with the game remotely, while they produced clothing. The new version included a sensor system that linked the sewing machine to a game server, allowing remote monitoring of player performance. By shifting from a production line to a domestic setting, we were able to observe how machinists could iterate and improve their skills over a batch of garments. This revealed how *Pocket Racer* could support learning through repetition, with crafted feedback loops encouraging players to strive for precision and mastery. 

My role in *Pocket Racer* involved designing and developing the game’s hardware and software. This work fed directly into [Gemma Potter’s PhD](https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/630759/), showcasing how crafted feedback loops and hybrid gameplay can create new opportunities for skill development in both playful and professional contexts. The blending of sewing precision with playful gaming logic remains one of our most exciting areas of exploration.

There’s also the mobile version of *Pocket Racer*, which takes the game off the table and attaches it directly to sewing machines. Instead of playing on a console, you’re racing using the actual controls of a sewing machine. It’s part of a broader exploration of how everyday production tools can be repurposed as playful interfaces. Watching people realize that a sewing machine can double as a racing game controller is always a highlight for us.

## The Graft ethos

At Graft Games, we’re not trying to "sell" craft or "gamify" it in the buzzword-y sense. We’re just curious about what happens when you treat these two spaces — making and playing — as one. Games have always asked for quick reactions, steady hands, and sharp focus. So does craft. By building experiences like *Hazuki Knit* and *Pocket Racer*, we’re giving people new ways to connect with those skills — and maybe see their own creative potential in a different light.

For us, that’s the most exciting part. It’s not just about the games, but about how people react when they see a Game Boy hooked up to a knitting machine or realize they’re about to race using a sewing machine. It’s in those little moments of surprise, recognition, and play where it all comes together. That’s what Graft Games is about.

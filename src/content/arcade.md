## Overview

![People laughing as they play The Mashing](arcade.jpg)

The [Awkward Arcade](https://awkwardarcade.co.uk) was an experimental arcade of games curated and assembled by me. It explores awkward, uncomfortable, and unconventional themes and experiences, challenging traditional ideas of fun and provoking a broad range of emotions and social interactions.

The three elements of awkwardness were **interactive** (where games that have unusual control schemes), **thematic** (where games explore themes such as work, love, or even death in ways not typically found in games), and **social** (interacting with arcade machines is a performant, public act, while most typical games are played privately). The arcade worked to challenge public conceptions of what games could be, for both seasoned gamers and the uninitiated.

## Origins

The project began in 2015 during the **Digital Media Labs residency**, where I developed *The Mashing*, an experimental digital game. Initially, I planned to create all the games for the arcade myself. However, I pivoted to run the arcade as a platform for new work, curating existing "awkward" games from creators active on sites like [itch.io](https://itch.io) and commissioning new pieces to form a touring collection.

This work was carried out while I was a resident of the **MadLab Arts+Tech accelerator programme**, supported by **Arts Council England** and **Innovate UK**.

## Bespoke cabinets and controllers

Each game in the Awkward Arcade was housed in a bespoke arcade cabinet or featured a custom controller, all created by me. These unique physical setups enhanced the interactive and unconventional nature of the games.

After the initial set of machines, I developed designs for lower effort/impact set of machines that used interlocking, laser-cut parts without additional hardware. These prototype machines were first displayed at [Now Play This, Somerset House](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/press/now-play-game-changers-another-way-play) in 2017.

This design evolved yet again for a third iteration of hardware, designed for [Dan Hett's The Loss Levels](https://danhett.itch.io/the-loss-levels), commissioned by Now Play This in 2018.

## Exhibitions

The Awkward Arcade has been shown at multiple venues and events across the UK, including **Now Play This at Somerset House**, **Manchester's Whitworth Gallery**, the **National Museum of Scotland**, and **Dare Protoplay at Caird Hall**. The arcade also popped up at numerous party and club events, bringing arcades back to social spaces with a modern twist.


Additionally, the game that started it all – _The Mashing_ – has gone on to appear at events at the **The V&A** and **GDC in California** (in collaboration with the [We Throw Switches](https://www.wethrowswitches.com/altarcade) team)

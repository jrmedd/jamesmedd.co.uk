As a **product designer, service designer, and accessibility specialist**, I had the challenge of contributing to the Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding (EBSS AF) project for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). This scheme aimed to ensure that approximately 2 million UK households could claim essential funding that the majority of the country had received automatically through their energy providers.

## Addressing the gaps in energy support

The project was designed to reach people without domestic energy contracts, such as residents in park homes, care homes, canal boats, and other living arrangements. These individuals were excluded from the standard mechanisms for energy discounts, such as monthly bill reductions or the gas price cap. Recognising the additional challenges faced by off-grid residents, we also developed an alternative fuel payment service.

## Rapid design and iteration under tight constraints

Delivering this critical service required an accelerated pace, first seen in similar approaches during COVID-19. Rapid policy changes meant our designs had to evolve quickly while adhering to strict constraints. Our primary goal was to maximise the number of eligible applicants while minimising potential for overpayments and safeguarding the service against fraud.

To meet these demands, I leveraged the **GOV.UK Prototype Kit**, which enabled seamless collaboration between myself and the content designer, which allowed us to produce near-production-ready frontend code. This setup facilitated quick user testing across diverse devices and demographics. During a two-week cycle of around 50 usability tests, at least 30% of participants accessed the service via mobile devices, with many others using tablets instead of traditional desktop PCs.

## Collaborating for efficiency and fairness

Given that local authorities were responsible for final checks and payments, collaboration with councils of varying sizes across the UK was paramount. This partnership ensured that the service was efficient, protected against fraud, and fair to all applicants. Daily interactions with these stakeholders were instrumental in refining the service to meet diverse needs.

## Delivering for overlooked communities

This was one of the most challenging projects of my career, but also one of the most rewarding. By focusing on individuals whose living circumstances are often overlooked by councils and central government, we created a service that delivered equitable support to as many people as possible. Shining a light on these communities reaffirmed the importance of inclusive design and reinforced my commitment to creating accessible and user-centered services.
